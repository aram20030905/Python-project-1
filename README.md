# Mad Libs Story Generator

The Mad Libs Story Generator is a Python project that allows users to create customized, humorous stories by filling in the blanks with specific words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives). The program prompts users to provide these words, then inserts them into predefined story templates, creating a fun and wacky final story. There are three available story templates:

1. **Hospital Story**
2. **Camping Adventure**
3. **Enchanted Castle Adventure**

Each template contains a series of placeholders that are filled based on the user's input, making each generated story unique and hilarious.


## Features

1. **Three Story Templates:**
    - Three story templates: Hospital Story, Camping Adventure, and Enchanted Castle Adventure.
    - User-friendly input prompts to collect various types of words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.).
    - Input validation to ensure proper data entry (e.g., numbers are entered for numeric prompts).
    - Randomly generated, fun, and personalized stories based on user input.
    - A simple interactive interface for selecting the story template.
